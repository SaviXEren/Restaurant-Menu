# Restaurant-Menu
This project is a visually appealing and fully responsive restaurant menu webpage designed using HTML and CSS. The layout features a clean and modern aesthetic with an eye-catching orange theme that gives the page a vibrant and welcoming feel. At the top, it showcases the restaurantâ€™s logo and name alongside a stylish tagline to greet visitors.

The main content area includes a well-structured menu divided into three categories: **Starters**, **Main Course**, and **Desserts**. Each section lists multiple items with their corresponding prices, formatted for readability and easy navigation. Every category is displayed in a separate card-style container with soft shadows and rounded edges, enhancing the user experience.

The design is mobile-friendly, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes using responsive styling. Elements such as the logo alignment and menu item layouts adjust for smaller devices to ensure readability and functionality.

Overall, this project serves as a professional and elegant example of a static restaurant menu page, ideal for use by cafes, restaurants, or food trucks looking for a simple yet impactful online menu presence.
